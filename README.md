# Windows Development Environment

This repository holds a configuration for a development environment.

Apply the configuration using WinGet. There are configuration components that
must be enabled before configurations can be applied. The first command only
needs to be run once.

```ps1
winget configure --enable
winget configure apps.dsc.yaml
```
